> Red Teaming is a cybersecurity assessment that involves adversary simulation, using real-world TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) to mimic advanced threats, test defenses, and improve an organisation's security posture.

## Overview
<span style="color:#00FF00;">‚û°Ô∏è</span>
I've earned the <a href="https://eu.badgr.com/public/assertions/p2xxJx0DQU2ffXblBNslLg" target="_blank">CRTO badge</a> from <a href="https://training.zeropointsecurity.co.uk/" target="_blank">Zero-Point Security</a>.
What I really liked about this course is that it has a good mix of explanations and hands-on exercises in the SnapLabs environment.

The **Certified Red Team Operator** certification is an **advanced course in offensive security**, focusing primarily on the use of **Cobalt Strike**, one of the main trade tools. The **course, exam, and all aspects of Zero Point Security are overseen by RastaMouse**.

## Key Takeaways from the Course
‚úÖ **Highly Recommended** ‚Äì Covers essential Red Team concepts.  
‚úÖ **Hands-on Experience** ‚Äì Work with **Cobalt Strike C2** in a fully functional lab.  
‚úÖ **Lifetime Access** ‚Äì Get free course updates and revisit materials anytime.  

## What I Really Liked About CRTO  

One of the best parts of this course was the deep hands-on experience with **Cobalt Strike and Red Teaming methodologies**. Here‚Äôs what stood out:  

- **Hands-on Experience with Cobalt Strike C2** ‚Äì Practical exercises covering **beacon management, payload staging, and real-world attack simulation**.  
- **Working with Artifacts in Cobalt Strike** ‚Äì Customizing **artifact kits** to improve **payload OPSEC and evasion**.  
- **Building a Custom C2 Profile** ‚Äì Crafting a **Malleable C2 profile** and learning how adversaries **mimic legitimate traffic**.  
- **Bypassing Windows Defender** ‚Äì Learning the **methodology** of systematically bypassing **Windows Defender.**.  
- **Understanding Red Teaming Configurations** ‚Äì Gaining insight into **Cobalt Strike infrastructure, OPSEC configurations, and stealth techniques**.  
- **No Flag Submission Needed** ‚Äì The exam is **purely technical**, and if you capture **at least 6 flags**, you **pass automatically**‚Äî**no need to submit a report!**  
- **Get Your Digital Certificate** ‚Äì Once you pass, **create an account on [Badgr](https://eu.badgr.com/){:target="_blank"} with the same email address you registered at [training.zeropointsecurity.co.uk](https://training.zeropointsecurity.co.uk/){:target="_blank"} to claim your digital certificate**.

## Simulation of Real-World Attacks

> The course teaches <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/enterprise/" target="_blank">tactics</a>, 
<a href="https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/enterprise/" target="_blank">techniques</a>, and 
<a href="https://attack.mitre.org/groups/" target="_blank">procedures (TTPs)</a> to **simulate real-world threats**, 
allowing security teams to test and enhance their detection and response capabilities while strengthening an organisation's overall security posture.

## Who Should Take CRTO?  

This course is **ideal for professionals looking to gain practical Red Teaming experience**, especially with **Cobalt Strike**.

‚úÖ **Penetration Testers** who want to transition into **Red Teaming**.  
‚úÖ **Security Analysts & SOC Teams** who want to understand **real-world adversary techniques**.  
‚úÖ **Aspiring Red Teamers** who want to master **Cobalt Strike, OPSEC, and evasion**.  
‚úÖ **Defensive Security Professionals** who want insight into **how attackers bypass security controls**.  

## Understanding TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures)

TTPs describe how attackers behave when compromising a system or network. Understanding them is **crucial for effective defense**. They are broken down into three categories:

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Tactics**
These are the **high-level strategic goals** of the attacker. They represent **what** the attacker is trying to achieve. Examples include:
- **Privilege Escalation**
- **Lateral Movement**
- **Persistence**
- **Data Exfiltration**
- **Initial Access**

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Techniques**
These are the **specific methods or tools** used to accomplish a tactic. They describe **how** the attacker achieves their goal. Examples include:

- **Privilege Escalation:** Kerberoasting, Pass-the-Hash, Exploiting known vulnerabilities.
- **Lateral Movement:** Pass-the-Hash, Remote Services, Valid Accounts.
- **Persistence:** Scheduled Tasks, Registry Keys, Backdoors.
- **Data Exfiltration:** FTP, HTTPS, DNS Tunneling.
- **Initial Access:** Phishing, Exploit public facing application.

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Procedures**
These are the **step-by-step implementations** of specific techniques within a particular attack. They describe the **specific way** an attacker uses a technique in a given scenario. 

Procedures are often **unique to an attacker or campaign** and provide the most granular level of detail. For example, a procedure might describe the **exact sequence of commands** used in a **Pass-the-Hash** attack, including the specific tools and parameters executed.

---

### **Summary:**
- **Tactics:** The attacker's **goal**.
- **Techniques:** The **methods** used to achieve the goal.
- **Procedures:** The **specific implementation** of a technique.

By understanding **TTPs**, defenders can **better anticipate, detect, and respond** to attacks, strengthening overall security posture.
