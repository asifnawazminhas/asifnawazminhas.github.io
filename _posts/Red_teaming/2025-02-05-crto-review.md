> Red Teaming is a cybersecurity assessment that involves adversary simulation, using real-world TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) to mimic advanced threats, test defenses, and improve an organisation's security posture.

## Overview
<span style="color:#00FF00;">‚û°Ô∏è</span>
I've earned the <a href="https://eu.badgr.com/public/assertions/p2xxJx0DQU2ffXblBNslLg" target="_blank">CRTO badge</a> from <a href="https://training.zeropointsecurity.co.uk/" target="_blank">Zero-Point Security</a>.
What I really liked about this course is that it has a good mix of explainations and doing hands on exercises in the snaplabs environment.

The **Certified Red Team Operator** certification is an **advanced course in offensive security**, focusing primarily on the use of **Cobalt Strike**, one of the main trade tools. The **course, exam, and all aspects of Zero Point Security are overseen by RastaMouse**.

## Key takeawasy from the course
‚úÖ **Highly Recommended** ‚Äì Covers essential Red Team concepts.  
‚úÖ **Hands-on Experience** ‚Äì Work with **Cobalt Strike C2** in a fully functional lab.  
‚úÖ **Lifetime Access** ‚Äì Get free course updates and revisit materials anytime.  

## Simulation real world attacks

> The course teaches <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/enterprise/" target="_blank">tactics</a>, 
<a href="https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/enterprise/" target="_blank">techniques</a>, and 
<a href="https://attack.mitre.org/groups/" target="_blank">procedures (TTPs)</a> to **simulate real-world threats**, 
allowing security teams to test and enhance their detection and response capabilities while strengthening an organisation's overall security posture.

## Understanding TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures)

TTPs describe how attackers behave when compromising a system or network. Understanding them is **crucial for effective defense**. They are broken down into three categories:

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Tactics**
These are the **high-level strategic goals** of the attacker. They represent **what** the attacker is trying to achieve. Examples include:
- **Privilege Escalation**
- **Lateral Movement**
- **Persistence**
- **Data Exfiltration**
- **Initial Access**

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Techniques**
These are the **specific methods or tools** used to accomplish a tactic. They describe **how** the attacker achieves their goal. Examples include:

- **Privilege Escalation:** Kerberoasting, Pass-the-Hash, Exploiting known vulnerabilities.
- **Lateral Movement:** Pass-the-Hash, Remote Services, Valid Accounts.
- **Persistence:** Scheduled Tasks, Registry Keys, Backdoors.
- **Data Exfiltration:** FTP, HTTPS, DNS Tunneling.
- **Initial Access:** Phishing, Exploit public facing application.

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Procedures**
These are the **step-by-step implementations** of specific techniques within a particular attack. They describe the **specific way** an attacker uses a technique in a given scenario. 

Procedures are often **unique to an attacker or campaign** and provide the most granular level of detail. For example, a procedure might describe the **exact sequence of commands** used in a **Pass-the-Hash** attack, including the specific tools and parameters executed.

---

### **Summary:**
- **Tactics:** The attacker's **goal**.
- **Techniques:** The **methods** used to achieve the goal.
- **Procedures:** The **specific implementation** of a technique.

By understanding **TTPs**, defenders can **better anticipate, detect, and respond** to attacks, strengthening overall security posture.

## Lab Environment

You have **lifetime access** to the lab environment, hosted on the <a href="https://www.thinkific.com/" target="_blank">Thinkific</a> platform.
The interface is well-structured, making it **smooth and intuitive** to navigate between modules.
The labs are hosted on **SnapLabs** and accessed via **Guacamole** in your web browser. I would recommended to use the **Google Chrome** browser, as it is likely to provide a **smoother experience** than other browsers.

## Exam Format: CTF-Style Challenge

One aspect of the **CRTO exam** that I really liked is its **CTF-style format**. The exam consists of **8 flags**, and you need to capture **at least 6** to pass. Each flag represents a critical step in the attack chain, such as **initial access, lateral movement, privilege escalation, or data exfiltration**.

Once you obtain a flag, you submit it in the **exam portal**, and your progress is instantly updated, this looks great! **No report writing, no documentation, needed to do, just pure technical execution.** If you collect **6 or more flags by the end of the exam**, you will pass. It's a **straightforward, hands-on, and practical approach** that focuses purely on **offensive security skills**.

The **course material starts off strong**, simulating a **full Red Team engagement** with **Defender both enabled and disabled**. **RastaMouse** has written the material **very concisely and relevantly**, ensuring it remains **practical and effective** for learners.

## Key Topics

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Command & Control (C2)
- Setting up and managing **Cobalt Strike**.
- Generating **payloads** and establishing **beacon communication**.
- Understanding **OPSEC considerations** to maintain stealth.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Privilege Escalation & Credential Theft
- Exploiting **Windows services** for **privilege escalation**.
- **Bypassing UAC** to gain higher privileges.
- Extracting credentials using **Mimikatz**, NTLM hashes, and Kerberos tickets.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Bypassing Defenses & OPSEC
- **Evading Windows Defender, AppLocker, and AMSI**.
- Understanding **common detection techniques** and how to **stay under the radar**.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Lateral Movement & User Impersonation
- Moving laterally within a network using **PsExec, WMI, and WinRM**.
- Using **Pass-the-Hash (PtH), Pass-the-Ticket (PtT)**, and **Kerberos ticket impersonation**.

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Post-Exploitation & Data Exfiltration
- **Gathering sensitive data** while maintaining stealth.
- Techniques for **exfiltrating data** without triggering alarms.

## Strategy for Success

A **strong approach** to the course is to **completely read through each section** and **create notes** as needed. The content is structured **logically** and designed to be **absorbed progressively**. This is also what I've done and would recommend to do.

## Additional Topics
Other important topics such as **host persistence**, **domain reconnaissance**, and **Active Directory enumeration** are covered in detail in the **full curriculum**.

## Final Thoughts

The **CRTO course** is one of the best ways to gain **practical experience** in **Active Directory exploitation and adversary simulation**. It provides a **structured approach** to **Red Team operations** and helps refine **stealth tactics** used in real-world engagements.

üöÄ **Highly recommended for anyone looking to advance their Red Teaming skills!**
