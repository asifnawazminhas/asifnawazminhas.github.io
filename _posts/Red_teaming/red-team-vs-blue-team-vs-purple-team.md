# Red Team vs Blue Team vs Purple Team

Modern cybersecurity is not a battle between offense and defense but it’s a **conversation**.  
The colour team model provides a framework to understand how organisations assess, defend, and continuously improve their security posture through collaboration.

In cybersecurity, *colour teams* represent distinct but interconnected disciplines that, together, simulate real-world threats and strengthen an organisation’s readiness.  

Each team has its own focus, but all share a common mission: building a security culture capable of learning, adapting, and improving with every engagement.

---

### Red Team: Offense with Purpose

The **Red Team** acts as a sanctioned adversary, replicating the **Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs)** of real attackers to measure how well an organisation detects, responds, and recovers.

* **Primary Role:** Simulate realistic attack scenarios under agreed-upon scope and authorization.  
* **Objective:** Achieve mission-level goals, such as accessing sensitive data or escalating privileges, while remaining undetected.  
* **Key characteristics:** Stealth and realism. A successful red team engagement tests more than technology: it evaluates human response, process maturity, and the effectiveness of defensive controls.

Unlike a traditional penetration test that enumerates vulnerabilities, red-team operations focus on **impact**, **intent**, and **detection evasion**, they actually mirror the decision making of genuine threat actors.

---

### Blue Team: Defense in Depth

The **Blue Team** forms the defensive backbone of an organisation.  
These analysts, engineers, and incident responders are responsible for identifying, containing, and mitigating attacks, both real and simulated.

* **Primary Role:** Detect, respond to, and recover from security incidents.  
* **Objective:** Maintain operational continuity while strengthening defensive capabilities.  
* **Key Activities:**  
  - Continuous monitoring through SIEM, EDR, and log analytics  
  - Threat-hunting and anomaly detection  
  - Forensic investigation and post-incident review  
  - Patch, configuration, and response automation  

During a red-team exercise, the Blue Team’s success is measured by **visibility** and **response speed**, how quickly can they detect, isolate, and neutralize simulated threats before business impact occurs?

---

### Purple Team — Collaboration in Action

The **Purple Team** is not a separate group of people; it’s a **function**, a mindset, and a bridge between offense and defense.  
It ensures that insights from red-team operations directly translate into measurable blue-team improvements.

* **Primary Role:** Facilitate continuous collaboration between Red and Blue Teams.  
* **Objective:** Transform every offensive technique into a defensive learning opportunity.  
* **How it Works:**  
  - Red Teams share **what** techniques they used and **why** they succeeded.  
  - Blue Teams share **what** they detected and **how** they responded.  
  - Purple Teams document gaps, align MITRE ATT&CK mappings, and validate fixes through iterative testing.  

> **Note:** A Purple Team isn’t always a dedicated headcount. It can be:
> - A **function** rotated among Red/Blue members
> - A **joint war room** during engagements
> - A **shared backlog** in Jira/Confluence with MITRE mappings
>
> The goal isn’t a new org chart — it’s **shared ownership of outcomes**.

The result is a living feedback loop — a **continuous improvement cycle** that drives detection engineering, analytics tuning, and faster defensive maturity.

## Insight from Mandiant: The Rise of AppSec in Red Teaming

> **“In intrusions where the initial intrusion vector was identified, 38% started with an exploit, up 6% from 2022. 28.7% of initial compromises came via public-facing web applications (MITRE T1190).”**

Traditional Red Teams often focus on network and infrastructure, but **attackers don’t**. They chain low-severity app flaws, reverse-engineer binaries, and exploit forgotten endpoints.  

Mandiant’s 2024 research shows that **integrating Application Security (AppSec) expertise into Red Team assessments** dramatically improves realism and impact:

- **Minimal access, maximum impact** — no need for domain admin if a webhook gets you RCE.  
- **Vulnerability chaining** — low/medium bugs become critical when combined.  
- **Custom exploits** — zero-days are built when PoCs don’t exist.  
- **Diverse skill sets** — AppSec + Red Team = creative, adversary-like attacks.  
- **Collaboration from day one** — AppSec isn’t a phase; it’s woven throughout.

## Quick Reference: Red vs Blue vs Purple

| **Aspect**           | **Red Team**                          | **Blue Team**                           | **Purple Team**                           |
|----------------------|---------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **Mindset**          | Attacker                              | Defender                                 | Collaborator                              |

## Beyond Competition: Co-Evolution

True resilience emerges when these disciplines stop operating in silos.  

- **Red Teams** challenge assumptions and expose weaknesses.  
- **Blue Teams** evolve detections and strengthen response capabilities.  
- **Purple Teams** unify the process, ensuring lessons are shared and improvements are verified.

This co-evolution transforms cybersecurity from a pass-fail test into a **measurable learning process** — where every engagement refines both offensive realism and defensive depth.

---

## Pro Tip: Build Adversary Emulation Plans

Move beyond one-off tests. Create **annual adversary emulation plans** (e.g., *“Emulate FIN7”*, *“Emulate Volt Typhoon”*) with:

- Pre-agreed TTPs (mapped to MITRE ATT&CK)  
- Clear success criteria (e.g., *“lateral movement undetected >48h = fail”*)  
- Blind vs. white-card testing modes  
- Automated retesting via **Atomic Red Team** playbooks

This turns Purple Teaming into a **program**, not an event.

---

## Why It Matters

Attackers collaborate far more than defenders often do.  
Embracing the Red-Blue-Purple model closes that gap, enabling teams to share intelligence, standardise feedback, and build a repeatable testing framework that improves over time.

When done right, purple-team collaboration becomes a continuous security validation cycle:

> **Adversary simulation → Detection → Feedback → Improvement → Retest**

It’s not about winning or losing — it’s about **raising the collective bar** for security readiness.

## Your Move: Start Small, Win Big

Pick **one** technique from your last red-team engagement that went undetected.  
Ask:  
> *“Could Blue detect this in production — blind?”*

If the answer is **no**, you’ve found your first Purple Team sprint.

Start there — every gap you close strengthens your overall resilience.
