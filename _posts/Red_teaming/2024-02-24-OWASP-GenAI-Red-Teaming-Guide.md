# Contribution to OWASP GenAI Red Teaming Guide

I have contributed to the [OWASP GenAI Red Teaming Guide](https://genai.owasp.org/resource/genai-red-teaming-guide/) as part of a collaborative effort. My contributions include **Key Differences Between Traditional and GenAI Red Teaming, Threat Modeling for Generative AI/LLM Systems, and Mature AI Red Teaming**. Additionally, I may have contributed to other sections, such as **Executive Summary, Quick Start Guide, AI Red Teaming Scope, Risks Addressed by GenAI Red Teaming, GenAI Red Teaming Strategy, and Blueprint for GenAI Red Teaming**. My input focused on refining **threat modeling, risk assessments, red teaming methodologies, and AI security frameworks**.

This guide serves as a **comprehensive resource** for security professionals, AI/ML engineers, and risk managers, addressing **generative AI vulnerabilities, attack vectors, and mitigation strategies**.
