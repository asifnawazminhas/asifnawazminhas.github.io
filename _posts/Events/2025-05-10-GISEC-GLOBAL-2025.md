## My Visit to Dubai & GISEC Global 2025

![GISEC1](assets/img/gisec1.jpeg)

From the **6th of May 2025** until the **8th of May 2025**, I had the opportunity to visit **Dubai (UAE)**. I flew with **Emirates Airlines** from Amsterdam (the Netherlands), and the experience was excellent. The food was great, the service top-notch, and the journey smooth overall. Iâ€™d personally recommend flying with Emirates to anyone heading to Dubai or travelling elsewhere.

While enjoying my holiday, I came across a LinkedIn post about [**GISEC Global 2025**](https://gisec.ae/){:target="_blank"}, which was taking place at the **Dubai World Trade Centre**. I registered on the spot and attended the event in person.

## What Makes GISEC Stand Out

[GISEC Global 2025](https://gisec.ae/){:target="_blank"} unites **25,000+ InfoSec leaders, CISOs, and ethical hackers from over 160 countries**. It's trusted by the worldâ€™s top cybersecurity brands and plays a vital role in empowering international collaboration and innovation.

As a **security engineer and ethical hacker**, I absolutely loved the atmosphere. It was inspiring to meet so many like-minded professionals and see new innovations, ideas, and various startupsâ€”especially those focused on **penetration testing, red teaming**, and **defensive tooling**. The mix of community, vendors, and forward-thinking technology was energising and left me with lots of ideas to explore further.

## Final Thoughts

Dubai was incredible, and **GISEC Global 2025** made the experience even more inspiring. The combination of global insight, the diversity of people, the innovative talks, and the energy of the event offered something truly valuable for anyone passionate about cybersecurity.

As a Dutch cybersecurity professional, I also believe that events like GISEC are a great example of what the Netherlands could engage in more actively. Participating in such international events not only brings visibility, but also opens up valuable opportunities for collaboration, innovation, and learning.

What stayed with me most was not just the innovation, but the opportunity to connect with passionate professionals from around the world. GISEC GLOBAL 2025 creates a powerful space for global knowledge sharing, and I hope to one day return â€” not just as an attendee, but as a speaker, sharing my own experiences and insights with the community.
