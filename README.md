## About

I’m **Asif Nawaz Minhas**, a penetration tester and cybersecurity researcher focused on **red teaming**, **responsible disclosure**, and **AI in offensive security**.  
This website serves as my personal knowledge base, featuring writeups, research notes, and insights on **ethical hacking**, **AI cyber security**, and **purple teaming**.

I also publish vulnerability research, responsible disclosure findings, and try to experiment on how AI can help build a more secure and peaceful internet.
